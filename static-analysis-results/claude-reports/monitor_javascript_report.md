1. Performance-Engineer Final Consolidated Report (Phase 2, verbatim)

Consolidated Performance/Aging Adjudication — project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js

Scope note: analysis is static-code verification only (Read/Grep against the file above, lines 1–176). No execution, profiling, or workload data was available; all "aging" classifications below are hypotheses requiring runtime confirmation, not confirmed empirical results.

---
Finding 1 — User-controlled regex compiled and executed synchronously per line (ReDoS)
- Contributing IDs: CR-1 + NS-2 (merged, same code path)
- Static validity: confirmed
- Code evidence: sanitizedRegex = new RegExp(command_regex, 'i') (line 63) is built from req.body.command_regex with only a syntax-validity try/catch (lines 61-69); it is then run via .filter(line => sanitizedRegex.test(line)) (line 91) against every line of ps output, synchronously on the event loop.
- Affected resource: the single Node.js event-loop thread (shared by all concurrent requests).
- Triggering condition: attacker-supplied pattern with nested quantifiers/alternation combined with sufficiently long matched-against lines — a runtime/workload-dependent assumption (line length in real ps output is not verified here).
- Existing cleanup/bounding: none — no length cap, no safe-regex check, no execution timeout, no offloading to a worker thread.
- Mechanism class: transient (but potentially severe) overhead per request — event loop stalls for the duration of one pathological .test() call, then resumes; no persistent state is created or retained.
- Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault. It satisfies "repeatable trigger" and "insufficient bounding," but fails "persistent accumulation/progressive exhaustion" — each occurrence is self-contained and does not compound with prior occurrences (no residual state grows). This is a DoS/latency vulnerability, not a software-aging mechanism.
- Final severity: high (unchanged from both reviewers) — final confidence: high (direct code evidence is unambiguous; only the exploitability magnitude is workload-dependent).

---
Finding 2 — No exec timeout, no maxBuffer override, and no captured child-process handle
- Contributing IDs: CR-2 + CR-3 + NS-1 + NS-3 (merged; all four cite the same executeCommand/exec call, lines 17-30, 73)
- Static validity: confirmed (as code fact) / qualified (as performance consequence)
- Code evidence: exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {...}) (line 19) is called with no options object, so Node's default maxBuffer (1 MB) and no timeout apply. The ChildProcess returned by exec(...) is never assigned to a variable anywhere in executeCommand, so no code path can call .kill() on it. No req.on('close', ...) exists in the route (lines 45-125).
- Two distinct sub-mechanisms verified:
  - (a) maxBuffer overflow: Node automatically kills the child process when the 1 MB default is exceeded and the pending Promise rejects (caught at line 118, surfaced as a 500). This is self-cleaning — no orphaned process, no residual memory — so it is a transient failure mode, not accumulation.
  - (b) No timeout + no cancellation on disconnect: if the underlying ps/shell process never exits (e.g., a hang), the Promise never settles, the request handler closure stays suspended indefinitely, and the child process is never killed since no reference exists to kill it. This requires the workload/runtime assumption that ps can actually hang, which none of CR-2/NS-1/NS-3 can verify statically.
- Affected resource: child-process/shell handles, process table entries, and the pending Promise/request-context memory for scenario (b) only.
- Existing cleanup: none for either sub-case.
- Mechanism class: (a) transient/self-resolving; (b) cumulative resource retention — but only under the unverified "hang" precondition.
- Aging relevance: (a) non-aging performance fault. (b) conditionally plausible aging mechanism — it has a repeatable trigger (repeated aborted/hung requests), no cleanup, and, if the hang precondition holds, produces genuine progressive accumulation of orphaned child processes over long-running execution. All four aging criteria are structurally present, but the triggering precondition (child process hanging) is itself unconfirmed and is the single most important runtime fact needed to validate this as real aging behavior.
- Final severity: medium (both reviewer sets agree) — final confidence: medium (code gap is confirmed; the aging-relevant sub-case (b) depends on an unverified hang assumption, so confidence for the aging framing specifically is lower than for the raw code defect).

---
Finding 3 — Unbounded concurrent process spawning (no concurrency cap/queue)
- Contributing IDs: CR-4 + NS-4 (merged)
- Static validity: confirmed
- Code evidence: every call into the handler (lines 45-125) unconditionally reaches await executeCommand(...) (line 73), and no semaphore, queue, or rate-limit middleware exists anywhere in the file (lines 1-176 reviewed in full).
- Affected resource: OS process table / file-descriptor table / CPU scheduling, shared across the host.
- Triggering condition: concurrent/burst request volume — an external workload assumption, not something the file itself controls (no auth/throttle is present to prevent it, which is confirmed).
- Existing cleanup/bounding: none.
- Mechanism class: finite-resource exhaustion under load, not steady-state accumulation. In the normal case (each ps completes quickly and exits), resources are released as soon as each request finishes — there is no growth over time absent concurrent load, so this is fundamentally a concurrency/capacity limit rather than a time-based aging curve. It only becomes a true aging-style accumulation if compounded with Finding 2(b) (hung processes never freed), in which case each hang leaves a permanent process-table entry that accumulates across the service's lifetime.
- Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault standalone (fails "progressive degradation during long-running execution" absent concurrent bursts or hangs); conditionally plausible aging mechanism only when combined with Finding 2's hang precondition.
- Final severity: medium (as both reviewers state) — final confidence: medium (code absence of any cap is directly confirmed; real-world concurrency/ulimit context is unverified).

---
Finding 4 — Synchronous, unbounded array processing of full command output
- Standalone: NS-5
- Static validity: confirmed
- Code evidence: after executeCommand resolves, the handler runs result.split('\n').filter(...) (line 76), lines.slice(headerLines) (line 87), then a chained .filter(...).map(...).filter(...) (lines 90-115) — all synchronous, single-pass-per-request, over the fully materialized string with no streaming, line cap, or chunking.
- Affected resource: main-thread CPU time and short-lived intermediate arrays (lines, processLines, mapped/filtered arrays) held only for the duration of one request.
- Triggering condition: large ps output (broad filter_flags or many host processes) — workload-dependent, unverified in this review.
- Existing cleanup/bounding: none, but note the arrays are request-scoped and become eligible for garbage collection once the response is sent — there is no evidence of any reference retained past line 117/123.
- Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead proportional to output size, not cumulative retention.
- Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault — fails "persistent accumulation" (no code path retains these arrays beyond the request), though it is a legitimate proportional-latency concern under sustained high process counts.
- Final severity: low (matches NS-5) — final confidence: medium.

---
Finding 5 — PID column-heuristic misidentification (CR-5)
- Standalone: CR-5
- Static validity: confirmed as a correctness issue; rejected for performance/aging relevance.
- Code evidence verified at lines 95-108 exactly as cited: the numeric-first-column heuristic can select a non-PID numeric field (e.g., a UID) if ps output ordering deviates from the assumption.
- Performance relevance: none — this affects the correctness of the returned processId field, not resource consumption, latency, or accumulation. It has no plausible aging mechanism (no repeatable resource trigger, no accumulation).
- Final severity/confidence: not applicable to this performance-focused adjudication (out of scope); included only to note it was correctly evaluated and excluded.

---
Finding 6 — Missing graceful shutdown / signal handling (NS-6)
- Standalone: NS-6
- Static validity: confirmed as a code fact.
- Code evidence: app.listen(PORT, () => {...}) (lines 160-176) does not capture the returned server handle, and no process.on('SIGTERM'|'SIGINT', ...) listener exists anywhere in the file.
- Performance relevance: conditional, and only at process-termination time, not during sustained runtime. This does not describe a degradation that accumulates while the service is running — it describes a single-event risk (connection resets, potentially orphaned children if a hang from Finding 2 coincided with shutdown) that occurs only when a termination signal arrives.
- Mechanism class: no ongoing performance impact; unsupported as an aging mechanism (fails "degradation during long-running execution" — this is a shutdown-instant event, not a runtime trend).
- Aging relevance: unrelated to performance aging in the sense defined by this task (it is an availability/operational-robustness gap, relevant chiefly at deploy/restart boundaries).
- Final severity: low (matches NS-6) — final confidence: medium.

---
SELF-SOURCED — UNVALIDATED (not cross-checked by either reviewer; not included above)

1. Synchronous console I/O on every request (lines 25, 72: console.log(\Executing: ps ${sanitizedFlags}`)andconsole.warn('Command stderr:', stderr)): console.log/console.warn` write synchronously when stdout/stderr are redirected to a file or non-TTY destination in many deployment configurations. Under sustained high request-rate operation, this adds a small but non-zero blocking I/O cost per request that is not bounded, capped, or batched anywhere in the file. This would need runtime confirmation of the actual stdout/stderr destination (TTY vs. file/pipe) in the deployment environment to determine whether it contributes any measurable cumulative overhead — it is not a resource-accumulation mechanism by itself, only a potential steady per-request cost.

(Only one item is presented; a second candidate considered — request-body-size/command-length exposure — was found to be already subsumed by Finding 1/Finding 3's evidence and was not sufficiently distinct to list separately.)

2. Appendix — Raw Phase-1 Handoffs (unedited)

Appendix A: CR-* (code-reviewer)

Code Review Findings — coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js

CR-1
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 61-63, 90-91
- fault and direct code evidence: The user-supplied command_regex body field is compiled directly into a live RegExp (sanitizedRegex = new RegExp(command_regex, 'i');, line 63) with no length cap, complexity check, or safe-regex validation, and is then executed synchronously against every parsed process line (.filter(line => sanitizedRegex.test(line)), line 91).
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → regex construction → processLines.filter(...) loop calling .test() per line inside the single-threaded event loop.
- affected state or resource: Node.js event loop / process (single-threaded execution).
- triggering conditions: A client submits a pathological regex (e.g. nested-quantifier patterns exhibiting catastrophic backtracking) evaluated against process lines long/complex enough to trigger exponential backtracking.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None — the only validation is a try/catch around new RegExp(...) (lines 61-69), which only rejects syntactically invalid patterns, not computationally expensive ones.
- plausible runtime consequence: The regex engine blocks the event loop for a long/unbounded duration, stalling all other in-flight requests on the same process (denial-of-service via a single request).
- severity: high; confidence: high
- assumptions needing validation: Actual ps output line lengths/content in the deployment environment, and whether any upstream WAF/regex-complexity guard exists outside this file.

CR-2
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 17-30, 73
- fault and direct code evidence: executeCommand wraps exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {...}) with no timeout option passed to exec, and the returned Promise has no cancellation tied to request lifecycle; called at line 73 with await executeCommand(\ps ${sanitizedFlags}`)`.
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → await executeCommand(...) → underlying child_process.exec spawn.
- affected state or resource: Child process handle / file descriptors / the pending Promise driving the request handler.
- triggering conditions: If the spawned ps process (or the shell it runs under) stalls or never exits (e.g., unusual flag combination causing blocking I/O, or the client disconnecting mid-request with no abort wiring), the Promise never resolves or rejects.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None — no timeout/killSignal option, no req.on('close', ...) handling to kill the child process on client disconnect.
- plausible runtime consequence: Indefinite retention of a pending request context and an orphaned child process; under repeated triggering this accumulates hung processes/handles.
- severity: med; confidence: med
- assumptions needing validation: Whether ps with attacker-influenced flags can actually be made to hang in the target OS environment, and whether the hosting platform enforces its own request/process timeouts.

CR-3
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 17-30, 73, 76-87
- fault and direct code evidence: exec(command, ...) at line 19 is called without an explicit maxBuffer override, leaving Node's default (1 MB) in effect; the full stdout is buffered before resolve(stdout) (line 27) and only then split/processed (line 76: result.split('\n')...).
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → exec accumulates entire ps output in memory → callback fires only after full buffering or maxBuffer overflow.
- affected state or resource: Node process heap (buffer holding full command output) and the child process (which Node kills automatically on maxBuffer overflow).
- triggering conditions: A system/container with a large number of processes, or filter_flags producing verbose output (e.g., wide/www style flags), causing output near or beyond 1 MB.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None — no streaming, no custom maxBuffer, no size guard before buffering.
- plausible runtime consequence: On exceeding the buffer, the request fails with a "stdout maxBuffer exceeded" error surfaced as a 500 response; below the limit but still large, each request briefly allocates a large string/buffer, adding avoidable memory pressure under concurrent load.
- severity: med; confidence: med
- assumptions needing validation: Typical process count/output size on the deployment host to know how close to the 1 MB default this realistically gets.

CR-4
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 45-73
- fault and direct code evidence: Every invocation of the /monitor/commands handler unconditionally calls executeCommand (line 73), which spawns a new OS shell + ps process (exec, line 19) with no request queueing, concurrency cap, or rate limiting anywhere in the route (lines 45-124).
- relevant execution path: Concurrent POST /monitor/commands requests → each independently reaches line 73 → each spawns its own shell/ps child process.
- affected state or resource: OS process table, file descriptors, CPU scheduling for the Node process and its children.
- triggering conditions: Multiple concurrent/rapid requests (no auth/throttle preventing repeated calls).
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None — no semaphore, queue, or per-client limiting present in the file.
- plausible runtime consequence: Under concurrent load, unbounded process creation degrades host responsiveness/throughput and can exhaust process/file-descriptor limits, indirectly starving the Node event loop via OS-level contention.
- severity: med; confidence: med
- assumptions needing validation: Actual concurrent request volume expected in production and OS-level process limits on the host.

CR-5
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 95-108
- fault and direct code evidence: PID extraction heuristic: if (/^\d+$/.test(parts[0])) { processId = parseInt(parts[0], 10); } else if (/^\d+$/.test(parts[1])) { ... } else { processId = parseInt(parts.find(part => /^\d+$/.test(part)), 10); } — this assumes the first purely-numeric column encountered is the PID.
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → per-line mapping of processLines (line 92-114) → this branch selects processId.
- affected state or resource: Correctness of the processId field returned to callers (data returned by the API, not internal execution state).
- triggering conditions: ps output where a non-PID leading column is itself fully numeric (e.g., numeric UID shown instead of username in some container/ps configurations, or certain filter_flags combinations that reorder columns), causing parts[0] or parts[1] to match /^\d+$/ while not actually being the PID.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: No column-position validation against the actual header line that was skipped (headerLines computed at lines 80-85 is used only to skip rows, never to map column index to field name).
- plausible runtime consequence: The API silently returns an incorrect processId (e.g., a UID or another numeric field) for affected rows, which is then reported as fact to downstream consumers/callers of this endpoint.
- severity: low; confidence: med
- assumptions needing validation: Which ps flag/OS combinations in the actual deployment target produce a numeric leading column that isn't the PID.

Appendix B: NS-* (node-specialist)

Findings

NS-1
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 17-30 and 73
- fault and direct code evidence: exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {...}) is called with no options object — no maxBuffer, no timeout — inside executeCommand, and invoked as await executeCommand(\ps ${sanitizedFlags}`). child_process.execbuffers the entire child stdout in memory before invoking the callback and enforces Node's defaultmaxBuffer(1 MB); it also has no defaulttimeout`.
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → executeCommand → exec() callback → resolve(stdout)/reject(error).
- affected state or resource: process-wide event loop and the request's Promise/HTTP response lifecycle; child process stdout buffer.
- triggering conditions: a host with many processes or a flag combination producing verbose output (e.g., filter_flags: "auxww") whose stdout exceeds ~1 MB; or ps blocking/hanging (e.g., waiting on a stalled /proc read).
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — no maxBuffer override (so large output triggers an ENOBUFS-style error that is caught and turns into a generic 500) and no timeout (so a hung ps process leaves the Promise permanently unsettled and the HTTP response open).
- plausible runtime consequence: unpredictable request failures on large process output, and potential indefinitely-hanging requests/open sockets when the child process does not exit, holding the connection until client/proxy timeout (if any).
- severity: med; confidence: high
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: actual ps output size on the target host relative to default maxBuffer, and whether any external reverse proxy enforces its own timeout that would mask the hang.

NS-2
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 63 and 91 (also 45-125)
- fault and direct code evidence: sanitizedRegex = new RegExp(command_regex, 'i'); builds a regex directly from unvalidated user input (req.body.command_regex), then it is executed synchronously per line: .filter(line => sanitizedRegex.test(line)).
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → regex construction → processLines.filter(...) executed synchronously on the main thread for every line of ps output.
- affected state or resource: the single Node.js event loop thread (shared across all concurrent requests).
- triggering conditions: a client supplies a pathological pattern with nested quantifiers/alternation (classic catastrophic-backtracking regex) combined with a line long enough to trigger exponential backtracking during .test().
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — there is no complexity/length bound on command_regex, no execution timeout for the regex test, and no worker-thread offloading; only a syntactic validity check (new RegExp construction) is performed, which does not catch backtracking risk.
- plausible runtime consequence: event-loop blocking for the duration of the pathological match, stalling all other concurrent requests being served by the same Node process (no clustering/worker isolation observed in this file).
- severity: high; confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: whether the regex engine (V8) and typical ps line lengths in this environment are sufficient to produce observable backtracking blowup versus merely a few extra milliseconds.

NS-3
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 17-30 and 45-125
- fault and direct code evidence: executeCommand wraps exec in a Promise with no reference to the child process object returned by exec(...), and the route handler app.post('/monitor/commands', async (req, res) => {...}) never registers a req.on('close', ...)/res.on('close', ...) listener to react to client disconnection.
- relevant execution path: client sends POST, then disconnects/aborts before the ps child process completes; executeCommand's callback still fires later and the async handler still attempts res.json(processes) (which will simply fail silently/no-op on a destroyed socket) or res.status(500).json(...) in the catch block.
- affected state or resource: the spawned child process/shell (never captured, so it cannot be terminated), and the pending Promise chain.
- triggering conditions: any client-side timeout, browser navigation away, or proxy-level abort while the ps command is still executing.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — the returned ChildProcess handle from exec() is discarded (only used inside the closure, not stored/exposed), so there is no code path to call .kill() on disconnect.
- plausible runtime consequence: orphaned/wasted child process execution continuing to consume CPU/IO after the originating request is abandoned, particularly harmful when combined with NS-1/NS-4 under repeated aborted requests.
- severity: med; confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: real-world client disconnect frequency and whether ps invocations are typically fast enough that this window is negligible in practice.

NS-4
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 17-30, 45-125, 160-176
- fault and direct code evidence: every invocation of the route handler unconditionally calls executeCommand(\ps ${sanitizedFlags}`), spawning a new shell + ps child process (execinternally uses/bin/sh -c), with no in-process concurrency guard, queue, or semaphore anywhere in the file, and app.listen(PORT, ...)` starts accepting connections with no concurrency-limiting middleware installed beforehand.
- relevant execution path: N concurrent POST requests to /monitor/commands each independently trigger exec(), running N shell+ps process pairs simultaneously.
- affected state or resource: OS process table / file descriptor table / CPU scheduler shared across the whole host process.
- triggering conditions: burst of concurrent requests (no rate limiting middleware is present in the module) each spawning its own subprocess.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — no rate-limiter, no max-concurrency counter, no queueing; each request is handled independently and symmetrically.
- plausible runtime consequence: under load, unbounded process creation can exhaust OS resources (max processes/FDs) or cause severe CPU contention, degrading or crashing the whole service including unrelated concurrent requests.
- severity: med; confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: actual expected request concurrency in deployment and host-level process/FD ulimits.

NS-5
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 76-116
- fault and direct code evidence: the full command output is materialized synchronously — const lines = result.split('\n').filter(...), then lines.slice(headerLines), then chained .filter(...).map(...).filter(...) over processLines — all performed on the already-fully-buffered string with no streaming/chunked processing.
- relevant execution path: after executeCommand resolves with the complete stdout string, the handler synchronously runs multiple array passes and a line.trim().split(/\s+/) per line before responding.
- affected state or resource: main thread CPU time during request handling; temporary arrays (lines, processLines, intermediate filtered/mapped arrays) held in memory for the duration of the request.
- triggering conditions: a host or flag combination (e.g., broad filter_flags) producing a very large number of process lines.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — no line-count cap, no incremental/streamed parsing; the entire dataset is processed in one synchronous pass chain.
- plausible runtime consequence: increased latency and event-loop blocking proportional to process count/output size, degrading throughput for all concurrently queued requests on the same event loop.
- severity: low; confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: typical process counts on target hosts; whether this synchronous work is large enough (vs. I/O wait dominating) to matter in practice.

NS-6
- file: coding-task-shared/javascript/project-bolt-monitor/project/index.js, lines 160-176
- fault and direct code evidence: app.listen(PORT, () => {...}) return value (the http.Server instance) is not captured, and there is no process.on('SIGTERM', ...)/SIGINT handler anywhere in the file to call server.close() or otherwise coordinate shutdown.
- relevant execution path: process receives a termination signal (container stop, deploy restart, orchestrator scale-down) while requests are in flight or child ps processes are executing.
- affected state or resource: in-flight HTTP connections and any child processes spawned via exec (see NS-3) that were still running at shutdown time.
- triggering conditions: any external termination signal sent to the Node process while a request/child process is active.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none present — no graceful-drain logic, no server handle retained, no signal listeners registered.
- plausible runtime consequence: abrupt connection resets for in-flight clients and no coordinated child-process cleanup, risking orphaned ps/shell processes surviving the parent's termination depending on OS process-group semantics.
- severity: low; confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: deployment/orchestration environment's signal-handling behavior and whether child processes are placed in the same process group as the Node parent.
