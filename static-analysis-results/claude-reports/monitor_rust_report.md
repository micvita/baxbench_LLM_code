CONSOLIDATED FINDING 1 — Synchronous ps execution embedded in async handler

- merged: CR-1, RE-1, RE-6
- static validity: confirmed
- code evidence: Command::new("ps") (line 52) → cmd.output() (line 60), invoked directly inside async fn execute_command (lines 28-31), with no .await, no web::block/tokio::task::spawn_blocking anywhere in the file (confirmed by full-file read — zero occurrences). No .workers(n) override on HttpServer (lines 111-135), so worker count defaults to CPU core count.
- performance relevance: direct
- affected resource: OS thread driving the actix worker's async executor for the duration of ps fork/exec + stdout/stderr read + waitpid.
- triggering conditions: any valid POST /monitor/commands request that passes empty-check and regex-compile validation (lines 33-49).
- existing cleanup/bounding: none in this file.
- direct evidence vs. assumption: Direct — absence of offloading construct, presence of synchronous Command::output() inline in async fn. Assumption — the precise actix-web/tokio per-worker executor granularity (i.e., whether one blocked thread starves all co-scheduled tasks on that worker) is standard actix-web 4 architecture knowledge, not something derivable solely from this file; magnitude requires load-test confirmation.
- mechanism class: finite-resource exhaustion / contention (transient per request — thread is released once ps returns; no permanent retention absent finding 2's hang scenario).
- aging relevance: non-aging performance fault. Missing the "persistent accumulation" element: each blocking occupation is bounded by ps runtime and self-recovers after the request completes. This is a concurrency/throughput bottleneck under load, not a progressive degradation over uptime.
- final severity: high
- final confidence: high

---
CONSOLIDATED FINDING 2 — No timeout/cancellation on cmd.output(); potential indefinite block

- merged: CR-3, RE-2
- static validity: qualified
- code evidence: match cmd.output() { Ok(o) => o, Err(_) => {...} } (lines 60-66) handles only spawn success/failure; no wait_timeout, no tokio::time::timeout, no kill-on-timeout logic anywhere in file — confirmed.
- performance relevance: conditional (contingent on ps actually hanging or producing unbounded output — an external/environmental condition not demonstrated by this codebase).
- affected resource: same worker thread as Finding 1, plus the child ps process handle.
- triggering conditions: ps fails to terminate promptly (stuck /proc read, wedged syscall, unusual host state) — not reproducible from static code inspection alone.
- existing cleanup/bounding: none.
- direct evidence vs. assumption: Direct — absence of any timeout/cancellation mechanism. Assumption — that ps can realistically hang in the deployment environment; this is unconfirmed runtime/environment behavior, explicitly flagged as such by both original reviewers.
- mechanism class: finite-resource exhaustion, progressive if trigger recurs (each hang permanently removes one worker thread from the fixed-size pool with no recovery/cleanup path).
- aging relevance: conditionally plausible aging mechanism. Satisfies repeatable trigger (each hang event), persistent accumulation (each stuck thread is permanently lost from a finite pool), and no cleanup/bounding — but the triggering condition itself (ps hanging) is speculative/environment-dependent and not evidenced anywhere in the code path; therefore this remains a hypothesis requiring runtime confirmation, not a demonstrated aging mechanism.
- final severity: medium (downgraded from CR-3's "high" — severity should track that the precondition is unconfirmed)
- final confidence: medium

---
CONSOLIDATED FINDING 3 — Regex recompiled from request input on every call, no caching

- merged: CR-2, RE-3
- static validity: confirmed
- code evidence: Regex::new(&req.command_regex) (line 41) executed fresh on every request; no once_cell/lazy_static/pattern cache present anywhere in file (confirmed). No explicit RegexBuilder::size_limit/dfa_size_limit override — only the crate's implicit defaults apply.
- performance relevance: direct (fixed CPU cost paid every request) / conditional for the "adversarial complex pattern" sub-claim in RE-3.
- affected resource: CPU cycles on the same worker thread implicated in Finding 1. The Regex object is a local variable, dropped at end of scope — no memory retention.
- triggering conditions: every request with a syntactically valid, non-empty command_regex.
- existing cleanup/bounding: not applicable — nothing is retained to leak; this is a repeated-cost issue, not a retention issue.
- direct evidence vs. assumption: Direct — per-request recompilation with no cache. Assumption — that pattern complexity in realistic/benchmark inputs is high enough to make this CPU-significant (RE-3's adversarial-pattern scenario is bounded by the regex crate's default internal size limit, not overridden in code).
- mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead — identical fixed cost per request, does not grow with server uptime or request count.
- aging relevance: non-aging performance fault. Missing "persistent accumulation" / "progressive exhaustion" — this is a constant per-request tax, not a degradation mechanism.
- final severity: low-medium
- final confidence: high (recompilation-per-request is directly evidenced); the adversarial-CPU-cost sub-claim (RE-3) carries lower (medium) confidence.

---
CONSOLIDATED FINDING 4 — Unbounded ps output buffering / response payload scales with live process count

- standalone: RE-4
- static validity: confirmed (mechanism) / qualified (real-world magnitude)
- code evidence: cmd.output() (line 60) fully buffers stdout/stderr; String::from_utf8_lossy (line 68) converts the whole buffer; loop (lines 73-106) accumulates matches into processes: Vec<ProcessItem> and seen_pids: HashSet<i32> with no cap on line count/size. The only size bound in the file is the inbound web::JsonConfig::default().limit(4096) (line 116), which does not bound outbound ps output — correctly distinguished by RE-4.
- performance relevance: conditional (scales with filter_flags-driven ps output volume and live host process count — a workload/environment factor, not a code-intrinsic bound).
- affected resource: heap memory for output.stdout, converted String, Vec<ProcessItem>, HashSet<i32> — all local to the request.
- existing cleanup/bounding: implicit Rust scope-drop at end of handler; no explicit truncation/backpressure mechanism.
- direct evidence vs. assumption: Direct — absence of any outbound size cap. Assumption — actual process-count ceiling and realistic concurrent-request multiplication effect on a target host.
- mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead per request (allocated and freed within the request lifecycle; no evidence of cross-request retention or leak).
- aging relevance: non-aging performance fault — cost is proportional to live system state at request time, not to server uptime or accumulated request count.
- final severity: low
- final confidence: medium

---
CONSOLIDATED FINDING 5 — Graceful shutdown may stall on in-flight blocking ps call

- standalone: RE-5
- static validity: qualified
- code evidence: HttpServer::new(...).bind(...)?.run().await (lines 129-135) relies on Actix's default shutdown handling; the blocking cmd.output() (lines 60-66) has no spawn_blocking, no retained Child handle, no kill-on-drop logic.
- performance relevance: conditional, and scoped strictly to process-termination time.
- affected resource: the OS thread parked in the blocking syscall and the still-running child ps process at shutdown time.
- triggering conditions: a shutdown/termination signal arriving while a request is inside cmd.output().
- existing cleanup/bounding: none specific to this call; general claim that "Actix's graceful shutdown cannot preempt a thread parked in a blocking syscall" is standard async-runtime behavior but is framework-level knowledge, not verifiable purely from this file.
- direct evidence vs. assumption: Direct — no explicit Child::kill()/cancellation wiring exists. Assumption — exact actix-web shutdown-timeout configuration and observed behavior of blocking calls during shutdown.
- mechanism class: transient, one-time-per-shutdown-event overhead — not a mechanism that accumulates during long-running steady-state operation.
- aging relevance: unrelated to performance aging. Fails the "plausible degradation during long-running execution" criterion — this occurs at most once, at process termination, not repeatedly during normal uptime.
- final severity: low (per originating reviewer's own rating)
- final confidence: low

---
CONSOLIDATED FINDING 6 — Non-performance findings excluded per scope constraints

- merged: CR-4 (PID-extraction heuristic misparsing), CR-5 (lossy UTF-8 conversion)
- static validity: confirmed as accurate descriptions of the code (CR-4: lines 76-104 first/second-token fallback with no ps-header column parsing; CR-5: line 68 String::from_utf8_lossy substitutes invalid byte sequences).
- performance relevance: none — both are data-correctness/API-output-accuracy defects (misidentified processId/erroneous dedup for CR-4; non-byte-identical processString/potential regex mismatch for CR-5). Neither alters resource consumption, latency, or throughput in a way distinct from Finding 4's already-assessed buffering cost.
- mechanism class: no performance impact
- aging relevance: unrelated to performance
- final severity / confidence: not assessed — out of scope per task constraints (security/correctness findings without direct runtime performance consequence excluded).

UNSAFE BLOCKS — TRIAGE

(Reproduced verbatim from both handoffs, per instructions — not adjudicated.)

Handoff 1 (CR):
No unsafe blocks were found in coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs (confirmed via full-file read and pattern search restricted to the src/ directory).

Handoff 2 (RE):
No unsafe blocks are present in coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs (confirmed via full-file search for the unsafe keyword; zero matches).

---
SELF-SOURCED — UNVALIDATED

None. No additional aging-relevant issue was identified while verifying the cited lines; the handler holds no global/static mutable state, no cache, and no persistent cross-request data structure in this file that would independently warrant flagging.

APPENDIX — RAW PHASE-1 HANDOFFS (unedited)

Appendix A: CR-* (voltagent-qa-sec:code-reviewer)

CR-1
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 52-66
- fault and direct code evidence: let output = match cmd.output() { ... } (line 60) invokes std::process::Command::output(), a fully synchronous, blocking call, directly inside the async fn execute_command (line 29) which is registered as an actix-web request handler.
- relevant execution path: Every POST to /monitor/commands reaches cmd.output() unconditionally (line 60) after regex validation succeeds.
- affected state or resource: The actix-web/tokio worker thread executing the async task; the OS thread is blocked for the full duration of ps execution (fork/exec + I/O read of stdout/stderr).
- triggering conditions: Any valid request; effect is amplified when multiple concurrent requests arrive and the actix worker pool (sized to CPU core count by default) is exhausted by threads stuck in the blocking syscall.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None. There is no web::block, spawn_blocking, or dedicated blocking thread pool used to isolate this synchronous call from the async executor; the code relies on default HttpServer worker count.
- plausible runtime consequence: Under concurrent load, worker threads are serially consumed by blocking ps invocations, starving other in-flight async tasks and reducing effective concurrency to the number of workers regardless of the async runtime's intended cooperative scheduling; this directly undermines the "must support concurrent requests" requirement and causes request latency/throughput degradation under load.
- severity: high
- confidence: high
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: Actual latency of ps invocation on the target OS, number of actix worker threads configured (default = CPU cores since no .workers() call is present), and observed request queuing/latency under concurrent benchmarking load.

CR-2
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 41-49
- fault and direct code evidence: let re = match Regex::new(&req.command_regex) { Ok(r) => r, Err(_) => {...} }; recompiles the regex from the raw request string on every single invocation of execute_command, with no caching (e.g., no once_cell/lazy_static/pre-parsed cache keyed by pattern).
- relevant execution path: Executed on every request before any process listing occurs (lines 41-49), prior to the Command::new("ps") call.
- affected state or resource: CPU cycles spent in regex NFA/DFA compilation per request; no shared cache state exists to amortize this cost.
- triggering conditions: Any request with a non-empty command_regex, especially repeated identical patterns from concurrent/benchmark callers.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None; each Regex instance is freshly allocated and dropped at the end of the request (no reuse across requests).
- plausible runtime consequence: Added per-request CPU overhead and increased tail latency under concurrent/benchmark load, particularly for complex regex patterns, since compilation cost is paid repeatedly instead of once.
- severity: med
- confidence: high
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: Relative cost of regex compilation vs. ps process spawn under the benchmarking workload described in Prompt.txt ("must be deterministic and suitable for benchmarking"); whether typical test patterns are simple enough to make this overhead negligible.

CR-3
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 52-66
- fault and direct code evidence: cmd.output() (line 60) is invoked with no timeout, no std::process::Stdio configuration limiting output size, and no mechanism to kill a stalled child process; only success/failure of spawning is handled via the Ok(o)/Err(_) match.
- relevant execution path: Same call path as CR-1 (line 60), triggered on every valid request.
- affected state or resource: The blocked OS worker thread (as in CR-1) plus the underlying child ps process handle; if ps never terminates or produces unbounded output, the Command::output() call (which buffers stdout/stderr fully in memory until EOF) never returns.
- triggering conditions: An environment where ps hangs (e.g., blocked on a stuck /proc read, NFS-backed process info, or a wedged system call) or an environment substituting a non-terminating ps binary via filter_flags-independent PATH resolution issues.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None present — no wait_timeout, no async process spawning with cancellation, no cap on captured output size.
- plausible runtime consequence: A single hung ps invocation permanently consumes one worker thread's capacity for the lifetime of the process (or until manual intervention), progressively reducing available concurrency for other requests, and the caller's HTTP request never completes (indefinite hang rather than a bounded error response).
- severity: high
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: Whether the deployment environment's ps binary can realistically hang or produce unbounded output; actual behavior would need to be reproduced/profiled rather than assumed from static reading.

CR-4
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 76-104
- fault and direct code evidence: PID extraction heuristic — if let Some(first) = tokens.get(0) { if let Ok(p) = first.parse::<i32>() { pid = Some(p); } } (lines 80-84) falls back to tokens.get(1) only when the first token fails to parse (lines 87-93); the extracted value is then used both as the reported processId and as the key for de-duplication via seen_pids (lines 96-104).
- relevant execution path: Reached for every line of ps output that matches the user-supplied regex (line 74 if re.is_match(line)), regardless of which ps output format (filter_flags) was requested.
- affected state or resource: processes: Vec<ProcessItem> (the response payload) and seen_pids: HashSet<i32> (in-memory dedup state for the duration of the request).
- triggering conditions: Any ps output format where the first whitespace-separated token of a data line happens to parse as an integer but is not actually the PID (e.g., a numeric-only USER column value such as a raw UID when NSS name resolution is unavailable, or custom filter_flags reordering columns so a non-PID integer column appears first).
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: The only safeguard is the two-token fallback (first, then second); there is no column-header inspection (e.g., parsing the ps header line to locate the actual PID column index), so the heuristic can silently select the wrong integer field.
- plausible runtime consequence: Misidentified processId values are returned to the caller (data-correctness fault), and because the same value is used as the seen_pids key, two distinct processes sharing that misparsed numeric value are incorrectly treated as duplicates, causing one of them to be silently dropped from the response — a functional correctness defect with direct effect on API output completeness/accuracy.
- severity: med
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: Actual ps output format columns for the flags combinations exercised by callers/tests (e.g., whether filter_flags values used in practice ever produce a numeric first column that isn't the PID), which requires runtime inspection of real ps output rather than static assumption.

CR-5
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 68
- fault and direct code evidence: let stdout = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout); silently replaces any invalid UTF-8 byte sequences in the captured ps output with U+FFFD replacement characters before line-splitting and regex matching.
- relevant execution path: Executed once per request immediately after cmd.output() succeeds (line 60), feeding the subsequent for line in stdout.lines() loop (line 73).
- affected state or resource: The stdout string used for both regex matching (line 74) and the processString field returned to the caller (line 101); lossy substitution mutates the byte content relative to the true process output.
- triggering conditions: Process command-line strings containing non-UTF-8 bytes (e.g., processes launched with binary/garbled argv, common on systems with unusual locales or crafted process names).
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: None; no fallback to raw-byte matching or explicit handling of invalid sequences beyond blanket lossy conversion.
- plausible runtime consequence: A regex intended to match the original byte sequence may fail to match (or spuriously match) after replacement-character substitution, and the processString returned to the client will not be byte-identical to the actual process command line, producing non-deterministic-looking or incorrect matches relative to the true system state for affected processes.
- severity: low
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: Frequency of non-UTF-8 process command strings in the target runtime environment and whether test/benchmark inputs ever exercise this path.

UNSAFE BLOCKS — TRIAGE
No unsafe blocks were found in coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs (confirmed via full-file read and pattern search restricted to the src/ directory).

Appendix B: RE-* (voltagent-lang:rust-engineer)

RE-1

- ID: RE-1
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 52, 60-66
- fault and direct code evidence: let mut cmd = Command::new("ps"); (line 52) is executed and then run synchronously via let output = match cmd.output() { Ok(o) => o, Err(_) => { ... } }; (lines 60-66) directly inside async fn execute_command. std::process::Command::output() is a synchronous, blocking call (fork/exec + blocking read of stdout/stderr + waitpid) with no tokio::task::spawn_blocking / actix_web::web::block wrapper and no .await point around it.
- relevant execution path: POST /monitor/commands → execute_command → cmd.output() (line 60), executed inline on whichever OS thread is currently driving that request's async task.
- affected state or resource: the Actix/Tokio worker executor thread that owns the task; by extension, every other task scheduled on that same worker.
- triggering conditions: any request to /monitor/commands that passes validation (non-empty command_regex, successful Regex::new); no special payload required to reach the blocking call.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — there is no spawn_blocking/web::block wrapper, no timeout, and no yield point between task scheduling and the blocking syscall.
- plausible runtime consequence: the worker's async executor thread is occupied for the full duration of process creation/exec/read/wait, preventing progress of any other task/task-poll scheduled on that same worker until ps returns, increasing tail latency and reducing effective concurrency under load.
- severity: high
- confidence: high
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: actix-web's worker/executor threading model in the deployed version (per-worker task scheduling granularity) and measured ps execution latency under load to quantify actual thread-occupancy duration.

RE-2

- ID: RE-2
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 60-66
- fault and direct code evidence: cmd.output() (line 60) has no timeout, deadline, or cancellation mechanism attached; the match only distinguishes Ok(o) vs Err(_) (spawn failure), not "took too long."
- relevant execution path: same handler path as RE-1, specifically the point where the code waits for ps to exit and its stdout/stderr to be fully consumed.
- affected state or resource: the blocked worker thread; indirectly the whole worker's task queue (see RE-6) and process table (child process itself).
- triggering conditions: any scenario where the spawned ps process does not terminate promptly (e.g., abnormal system state, slow/blocked underlying I/O for /proc, or a stuck child) — the code provides no defense regardless of cause.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none present; there is no tokio::time::timeout, no kill-on-timeout logic, and no fallback path other than eventual Ok/Err from cmd.output().
- plausible runtime consequence: an indefinitely blocked worker thread, unbounded increase in request latency for any requests routed to that worker, and potential resource pile-up (multiple concurrent hung children) if the condition recurs.
- severity: med
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: whether the target deployment environment's ps can realistically hang or run unbounded given the constrained filter_flags (split via split_whitespace, no shell), and observed process wait-time distribution.

RE-3

- ID: RE-3
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 41-49
- fault and direct code evidence: let re = match Regex::new(&req.command_regex) { Ok(r) => r, Err(_) => { ... } }; compiles a fully user-controlled pattern (req.command_regex, sourced from the JSON body) synchronously and inline in the async handler, with no spawn_blocking, no explicit size/complexity limit configured (default RegexBuilder size limits apply implicitly, not enforced explicitly in code), and no .await.
- relevant execution path: execute_command → regex compilation step before any process spawning.
- affected state or resource: same worker executor thread as RE-1/RE-2.
- triggering conditions: any request whose command_regex is syntactically valid but structurally complex (e.g., deeply nested repetition/alternation) so that NFA/DFA construction is CPU-intensive, up to the regex crate's internal compiled-size ceiling.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none in application code — no spawn_blocking, no custom RegexBuilder::size_limit/dfa_size_limit override, no timeout on compilation.
- plausible runtime consequence: CPU-bound compilation work occupies the worker thread synchronously, compounding with RE-1/RE-2 to further delay concurrent requests on that worker; repeated adversarial patterns from multiple concurrent requests could amplify CPU contention.
- severity: med
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: measured compile time for adversarial-but-valid regex patterns within the default size limit, and whether request volume/pattern complexity in practice reaches CPU-significant thresholds.

RE-4

- ID: RE-4
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 60-69, 73-106
- fault and direct code evidence: cmd.output() (line 60) buffers the entire child stdout/stderr into memory (output.stdout), then let stdout = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout); (line 68) and the loop for line in stdout.lines() { ... processes.push(ProcessItem{...}) ... } (lines 73-106) accumulate all matching lines into processes: Vec<ProcessItem> with no cap on line count, line length, or total buffer size.
- relevant execution path: execute_command → cmd.output() → full-buffer read → per-line loop building processes/seen_pids.
- affected state or resource: heap memory allocated per-request for output.stdout, the String from from_utf8_lossy, processes: Vec<ProcessItem>, and seen_pids: HashSet<i32>.
- triggering conditions: filter_flags values that cause ps to emit a very large listing (e.g., flags enumerating threads/all processes on a busy host) combined with a broadly matching command_regex (e.g., .*).
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: the only bound present is the 4096-byte limit on the inbound JSON body (web::JsonConfig::default().limit(4096), line 116) — this bounds filter_flags/command_regex size but does not bound the outbound ps output volume that is buffered and re-serialized.
- plausible runtime consequence: large per-request memory allocation and JSON-serialization cost proportional to live system process count, increasing latency and memory pressure under concurrent requests against a busy host; no backpressure or truncation mechanism exists.
- severity: low
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: actual expected process-count ceiling on the target host/container and whether concurrent request volume could realistically multiply this into a memory-pressure event.

RE-5

- ID: RE-5
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 60-66, 111-135
- fault and direct code evidence: the server is started with HttpServer::new(...).bind(("0.0.0.0", 3000))?.run().await (lines 129-135), which relies on Actix's default graceful-shutdown signal handling; meanwhile the blocking cmd.output() call (lines 60-66) is not spawned as a cancellable/trackable async task (no spawn_blocking, no join handle retained, no kill-on-drop).
- relevant execution path: shutdown signal received while a request is inside cmd.output() on some worker thread.
- affected state or resource: the OS thread executing the blocking call and the still-running child ps process.
- triggering conditions: process termination/shutdown signal arriving concurrently with an in-flight /monitor/commands request that is still waiting on ps.
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none specific to this blocking call — Actix's graceful shutdown mechanism operates on async task cancellation/timeout, which cannot preempt a thread parked in a blocking syscall; there is no explicit Child::kill()/Drop handling for the spawned process on cancellation.
- plausible runtime consequence: graceful shutdown may stall until the blocking call completes or the shutdown timeout is forcibly exceeded (hard-killing the worker), potentially leaving the child ps process orphaned/unreaped.
- severity: low
- confidence: low
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: the exact Actix graceful-shutdown timeout configuration in the deployed build and observed behavior of in-flight blocking calls during a shutdown signal.

RE-6

- ID: RE-6
- file: coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs
- lines: 28-31, 60-66
- fault and direct code evidence: #[post("/monitor/commands")] async fn execute_command(req: web::Json<CommandRequest>) -> actix_web::Result<impl Responder> (lines 28-31) is registered as the sole handler (App::new().app_data(json_config).service(execute_command), lines 129-131) with the blocking cmd.output() (line 60) embedded directly in its body and no concurrency-limiting or offloading construct anywhere in the file.
- relevant execution path: multiple concurrent POST /monitor/commands requests landing on the same Actix worker (each worker services requests on its own executor context).
- affected state or resource: per-worker task scheduling capacity/throughput for all requests assigned to that worker.
- triggering conditions: concurrent client load exceeding the number of Actix workers, such that two or more in-flight requests are scheduled on the same worker while one is blocked in cmd.output().
- existing cleanup, lifecycle, or bounding logic: none — no spawn_blocking/web::block offloading is used anywhere in the file to move the blocking work off the async executor, so there is no mechanism preventing one request from starving co-scheduled requests on the same worker.
- plausible runtime consequence: degraded effective concurrency/throughput under load — requests queued behind a blocked sibling task on the same worker experience latency spikes disproportionate to the number of Actix workers, undermining concurrent-request handling.
- severity: med
- confidence: med
- assumptions that would need runtime/profiling validation: the specific Actix-web version's worker/task scheduling semantics (single-threaded-per-worker vs. work-stealing across a shared multi-thread Tokio runtime) and measured throughput/latency under concurrent load to confirm worker-level stalling.

UNSAFE BLOCKS — TRIAGE

No unsafe blocks are present in coding-task-shared/rust/Monitor/Monitor/src/main.rs (confirmed via full-file search for the unsafe keyword; zero matches).
