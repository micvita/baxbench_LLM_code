1. Performance-Engineer's Final Consolidated Report (verbatim)

Adjudication Report — coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py

All findings verified directly against the cited lines in the actual file (confirmed current line numbers match cited line numbers). This is a stateless, single-file Flask service: no global caches, no long-lived in-memory accumulators, and no unclosed resources (all file opens use with and are properly closed) were found anywhere in the file. This materially affects aging classification below: nothing in this file exhibits persistent, cross-request accumulation — costs are paid and released per-request. Classifications reflect that structural fact.

---
F1 — Unbounded/uncomplexity-checked user-supplied regex (ReDoS)

Merged from: CR-1, FL-1
Static validity: confirmed — lines 140–146 show only a 256-char length cap; line 161 re.compile(command_regex); line 170 pattern.search(cmd) executed once per PID inside the loop at 166–170. No complexity/backtracking guard or timeout exists anywhere in the file.
Performance relevance: direct.
Affected resource / trigger / cleanup: CPU time of the request-handling thread; triggered by a caller-supplied regex with catastrophic-backtracking structure matched against cmdline strings (up to the 4096-byte read cap at line 54); only mitigations are the length cap (145) and re.error handling for syntax errors (161–163), neither of which bounds match-time complexity.
Evidence vs. assumption: the validation gap is direct code evidence; actual backtracking blow-up magnitude is pattern- and data-dependent and cannot be confirmed statically (both source reviews flagged this same limitation).
Mechanism class: finite-resource exhaustion (CPU/worker) — a single request can fully consume match-processing capacity; no cross-request retention.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault. Impact is single-shot/immediate rather than a gradually-accumulating degradation; it fails the "progressive exhaustion over long-running execution" element required for a supported aging mechanism (one request suffices for full impact, no accumulation needed).
Final severity: high. Final confidence: medium (structural flaw is certain; real-world exploitability is pattern/workload dependent, per both source reviewers' own caveats).

---
F2 — Full synchronous /proc re-scan on every request, no caching/bounding

Merged from: CR-4, FL-3
Static validity: confirmed — _list_pids() (98–110) calls os.listdir("/proc") fresh every invocation; _match_processes (165–177) opens/reads cmdline per returned PID; no memoization, cache, or pagination exists (the app object at line 23 holds no shared state).
Performance relevance: direct (structural) / conditional (magnitude depends on host process count and call frequency).
Affected resource / trigger / cleanup: per-request filesystem I/O and CPU proportional to total host PID count; triggered by any call to POST /monitor/commands, including identical repeated queries; max_bytes caps (39, 54, 63) bound only per-file cost, not PID count or call rate.
Evidence vs. assumption: absence of caching/bounding is direct; actual latency depends on the (environment-dependent, unverifiable-statically) number of processes on the deployment host.
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead — cost is fully re-derived and released each request; no internal growing state.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault as an intrinsic property of this file. A conditionally plausible aging-like effect exists only if the host's live process count itself trends upward over host uptime — an external, environment-dependent condition not evidenced anywhere in this code and requiring runtime observation to confirm.
Final severity: medium. Final confidence: high (code-level absence of caching is unambiguous; performance magnitude is workload/host dependent).

---
F3 — Unbounded result list / response payload size

Merged from: CR-5, FL-5
Static validity: confirmed — results (line 165) accumulates one entry per match with no cap; jsonify(matches) (200) serializes the full list; no limit/pagination logic exists in _validate_payload (135–155) or _match_processes (158–177).
Performance relevance: conditional (depends on regex breadth and matching process count; note the UI's own default values — command_regex="python.*" line 239, filter_flags="aux" line 243 — are directly-evidenced examples of a broad common-case query).
Affected resource / trigger / cleanup: in-memory results list plus serialization/network cost, scaling with match count; triggered by broad regexes (e.g., .*); no cap enforced anywhere.
Evidence vs. assumption: absence of bound is direct; payload-size impact depends on actual host process population at call time (unverifiable statically).
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead proportional to per-request match count; list is not retained past the request/response cycle.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault — no accumulation across requests; fails the "persistent accumulation" element.
Final severity: low-medium. Final confidence: medium.

---
F4 — Extra per-match syscalls when filter_flags includes user info

Merged from: CR-6, FL-6
Static validity: confirmed — _build_process_string (113–132) triggers _read_user (67–73: os.stat + pwd.getpwuid) and _read_stat (76–95: additional /proc/<pid>/stat read/parse) per matched PID when include_user is true (line 123: "u" in flags or "aux" in flags.replace(" ", "")), on top of the cmdline read already performed by the caller.
Performance relevance: conditional (depends on filter_flags containing u/aux — directly the UI's own default, line 243 — and on match count).
Affected resource / trigger / cleanup: additional per-matched-PID syscall/file I/O; try/except Exception wraps each helper (69–73, 85–95) to avoid crashes but provides no batching/memoization/bound on matched-PID count.
Evidence vs. assumption: the extra-syscalls-per-match structure is direct; actual latency contribution is OS/filesystem and usage-frequency dependent.
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead proportional to match count; compounds F2/F3 within a single request only.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault.
Final severity: low. Final confidence: medium.

---
F5 — Single-threaded/single-worker WSGI dev server as entrypoint

Standalone: FL-2
Static validity: confirmed — line 330: app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=3000, debug=False) with no threaded=True and no processes= argument; no alternate WSGI server invocation appears in this file.
Performance relevance: direct as a structural bottleneck / conditional as to real-world impact.
Affected resource / trigger / cleanup: all concurrent HTTP connections (including /health, 306–308) are serialized behind a single execution context if the built-in dev server's documented default (serial handling absent threaded/processes) applies; triggered by any concurrent request arriving during a long-running prior request (e.g., F1, F2); no timeout/threading configuration present in this file.
Evidence vs. assumption: the missing threaded=True/processes= argument is direct code evidence; the specific "one request at a time" runtime consequence relies on Werkzeug's documented default behavior (framework-level knowledge, not verifiable from this file alone) and, critically, on the assumption that this __main__ block is the actual production entrypoint rather than being superseded by an external WSGI server (gunicorn, etc.) — an environment-dependent assumption explicitly flagged by the original reviewer.
Mechanism class: not an accumulation mechanism — a fixed-capacity structural constraint present from process start that amplifies the effective blast radius/duration of F1 and F2 under concurrent load.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault. It is a static configuration limitation, not a mechanism that progressively worsens with uptime on its own.
Final severity: high (as an amplifier of F1/F2). Final confidence: medium (contingent on the unverified deployment assumption that this file's __main__ block is what actually runs in production).

---
F6 — No request body size limit; full in-memory buffering before validation

Standalone: FL-4
Static validity: confirmed — Flask(__name__) (line 23) sets no MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH; request.get_json(silent=True) (186), request.data (188), and json.loads (191) operate on the full body before any size check; the only length checks (145, 152) apply to already-parsed individual string fields, not the raw body.
Performance relevance: conditional (depends on client-supplied body size).
Affected resource / trigger / cleanup: per-request memory for raw body buffer and parsed JSON; triggered by an arbitrarily large POST body; no size-level bounding exists in this file.
Evidence vs. assumption: absence of a size limit is direct code evidence; Flask's MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH default of None is a framework-default assumption (consistent with, but not directly stated in, this file); whether an upstream reverse proxy enforces a limit in actual deployment is an unverifiable environment assumption.
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead — memory allocated and released per request; no evidence of retention across requests.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault — a per-request spike, not a cumulative mechanism.
Final severity: medium. Final confidence: high (code-level absence unambiguous; likelihood/magnitude is deployment-dependent).

---
Rejected (out of performance scope, not counted toward the 6)

- CR-2 (4096-byte cmdline truncation, lines 53–54): confirmed as code fact, but the consequence described (silent false-negative matching) is a correctness/completeness defect, not a runtime-cost issue — fixed-cost bounded read, no performance relevance.
- CR-3 (broad except Exception collapsing permission errors and empty cmdlines, lines 42–43/60–64/168–169): confirmed as code fact, but the consequence is incomplete/incorrect scan results under restricted privileges, not a runtime-cost issue — no performance relevance.

---
SELF-SOURCED — UNVALIDATED (not cross-checked, not part of consolidated findings)

1. No per-request caching of regex compilation/results for repeated identical command_regex values. Every call to /monitor/commands re-executes re.compile(command_regex) (line 161) and the full match loop (166–177) from scratch, even for byte-identical repeated queries (e.g., a polling client re-sending the same command_regex/filter_flags). This compounds F1/F2's per-request cost but is not itself an accumulation mechanism (no state retained) — flagged only as a possible additional repeated-overhead contributor, unconfirmed by either source review.
2. app.run invoked with debug=False but no explicit request/connection timeout of any kind (line 330). Combined with F1 and F5, a hung regex match has no server-side time bound to force connection termination; this is a plausible contributing factor to F5's severity but was not explicitly cited by either reviewer as a distinct finding, so it is listed here rather than folded into F5.

2. Appendix — Raw Phase-1 Handoffs (unedited)

Appendix A: CR-1..CR-6 (code-reviewer)

Code Review Findings — coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py

CR-1

- ID / file / lines: CR-1, monitor.py, lines 140–163, 170
- Fault and code evidence: A user-supplied string is compiled directly as a Python regex and executed against process command lines with no complexity/backtracking guard:
140  command_regex = payload.get("command_regex")
145  if len(command_regex) > 256:
161  pattern = re.compile(command_regex)
170  if pattern.search(cmd):
- The only mitigation is a 256-character length cap (line 145); this does not bound backtracking (e.g. patterns like (a+)+$ or (a|a)*b are short but exponential).
- Execution path: POST /monitor/commands → _validate_payload → _match_processes → re.compile(command_regex) → pattern.search(cmd) executed once per PID in /proc.
- Affected state/resource: CPU time of the request-handling worker/thread; re module has no built-in timeout in the stdlib.
- Triggering conditions: Attacker-or-caller-supplied command_regex containing catastrophic-backtracking constructs, matched against sufficiently long cmd strings (cmdlines up to 4096 bytes read at line 54).
- Existing cleanup/bounding logic: Only string-length validation (line 145) and re.error catching for malformed patterns (lines 161–163); neither bounds runtime complexity.
- Plausible runtime consequence: Regex evaluation can hang for a very long time (potentially indefinitely relative to request timeouts), consuming CPU and blocking that worker's ability to serve other requests.
- Severity: high; Confidence: high
- Assumptions needing validation: Actual backtracking blow-up depends on the specific pattern supplied and cmdline content; would need profiling with known ReDoS patterns against real /proc data to confirm magnitude.

CR-2

- ID / file / lines: CR-2, monitor.py, lines 46–64 (specifically line 54)
- Fault and code evidence:
53  with open(cmd_path, "rb") as f:
54      raw = f.read(4096)
- /proc/<pid>/cmdline is read with a hard 4096-byte cap; no check for whether more data exists.
- Execution path: _match_processes → _read_cmdline(pid) → truncated cmd string → pattern.search(cmd).
- Affected state/resource: Correctness of the cmd string used for matching.
- Triggering conditions: Any process with a command line exceeding 4096 bytes (common for processes with large argument lists, e.g. long classpaths, many --flag=value arguments).
- Existing cleanup/bounding logic: The cap exists purely to bound I/O; there is no fallback to read more or to flag truncation, so it silently limits what portion of the cmdline is searchable.
- Plausible runtime consequence: command_regex patterns intended to match content beyond byte 4096 will silently fail to match, producing false negatives (missing entries in the API response) with no error signal to the caller.
- Severity: med; Confidence: med
- Assumptions needing validation: Requires observing real-world processes with cmdlines exceeding 4096 bytes on the target host to confirm this is reachable in practice.

CR-3

- ID / file / lines: CR-3, monitor.py, lines 42–43, 60–64, 168–169
- Fault and code evidence:
42  except Exception:
43      return ""
...
60  except Exception:
61      pass
63  comm = _safe_read_text(f"/proc/{pid}/comm", max_bytes=256).strip()
64  return comm
...
168 if not cmd:
169     continue
- Any exception while reading /proc/<pid>/cmdline (including PermissionError for processes owned by other users) is swallowed identically to a genuinely-empty cmdline, and the fallback to comm may also fail/be empty, causing the PID to be silently skipped.
- Execution path: _match_processes iterates all PIDs from _list_pids(); for each, _read_cmdline is called and failures collapse to "", causing continue at line 169 with no distinction from "no cmdline."
- Affected state/resource: Completeness/correctness of the returned match set.
- Triggering conditions: Service not run as root (or without matching capabilities) alongside processes owned by other users — accessing their /proc/<pid>/cmdline raises PermissionError, which is caught broadly.
- Existing cleanup/bounding logic: The broad except Exception blocks handle the failure by returning an empty string, but they provide no way to distinguish "process not found/gone" (benign) from "permission denied" (systemic) or other I/O errors.
- Plausible runtime consequence: Under restricted privileges, the endpoint silently returns incomplete results (missing entire classes of processes) with no indication that the scan was partial, which is a functional/correctness defect surfaced only under specific runtime privilege conditions.
- Severity: med; Confidence: med
- Assumptions needing validation: Depends on the UID the service runs as versus the UIDs of target processes on the host; would need to confirm via runtime observation whether PermissionError is actually raised for cross-user /proc/<pid>/cmdline access on the deployment target.

CR-4

- ID / file / lines: CR-4, monitor.py, lines 98–110, 165–177
- Fault and code evidence:
101  for name in os.listdir("/proc"):
...
166  for pid in _list_pids():
167      cmd = _read_cmdline(pid)
- Every call to POST /monitor/commands performs a full, synchronous re-enumeration of /proc and opens/reads a file (cmdline, and possibly comm) for every single PID present on the host, regardless of match specificity — there is no caching, memoization, or upper bound on the number of PIDs processed per request.
- Execution path: monitor_commands → _match_processes → _list_pids (full /proc directory listing) → per-PID _read_cmdline file open/read.
- Affected state/resource: Per-request I/O and CPU cost; scales linearly (at minimum) with total process count on the host, not with match count.
- Triggering conditions: Any request to the endpoint on a host with a large number of running processes, or repeated/polling calls to the endpoint.
- Existing cleanup/bounding logic: max_bytes caps exist per-file read (lines 39, 54, 63) but there is no cap on the number of PIDs scanned or on request frequency/cost.
- Plausible runtime consequence: Response latency grows with total host process count on every call regardless of the regex's selectivity; frequent polling by the UI or automated clients multiplies this cost with no caching layer to amortize it.
- Severity: med; Confidence: high
- Assumptions needing validation: Actual latency impact depends on the number of processes typically present on the deployment host and expected call frequency — would need profiling under realistic process counts.

CR-5

- ID / file / lines: CR-5, monitor.py, lines 165–177, 197–200
- Fault and code evidence:
165  results: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
166  for pid in _list_pids():
...
171      results.append(...)
...
177  return results
...
199  matches = _match_processes(...)
200  return jsonify(matches), 200
- There is no limit on the number of entries appended to results, nor any pagination/truncation before serialization via jsonify.
- Execution path: monitor_commands → _match_processes accumulates unbounded list → jsonify(matches) serializes the entire list in a single response.
- Affected state/resource: Response payload size; in-memory results list held for the duration of the request.
- Triggering conditions: A broadly-matching command_regex (e.g. .*, or the UI's own default value python.* on a host with many Python processes) against a host with many matching processes.
- Existing cleanup/bounding logic: None — no LIMIT/pagination parameter, no maximum result count enforced anywhere in _match_processes or monitor_commands.
- Plausible runtime consequence: A single broad query can generate a very large JSON response, increasing serialization time, memory footprint, and network transfer time proportionally to the number of matching processes on the host, with no safeguard against pathological worst case (matching every process on the system).
- Severity: low-med; Confidence: med
- Assumptions needing validation: Depends on typical/maximum number of matching processes in production; would need load data to quantify actual payload sizes encountered.

CR-6

- ID / file / lines: CR-6, monitor.py, lines 113–132, 67–73, 76–95
- Fault and code evidence:
123  include_user = ("u" in flags) or ("aux" in flags.replace(" ", ""))
125  if include_user:
126      user = _read_user(pid)
127      st = _read_stat(pid)
- When include_user is true (triggered by the UI's own default filter_flags value of "aux", line 243), each matched process incurs two additional synchronous /proc operations (os.stat + pwd.getpwuid in _read_user, and a separate file read+parse of /proc/<pid>/stat in _read_stat) on top of the initial cmdline read already done in _match_processes.
- Execution path: _match_processes → per-match call to _build_process_string (line 174) → _read_user (lines 67–73) and _read_stat (lines 76–95), each performing independent file/syscall access per matched PID.
- Affected state/resource: Per-match I/O/syscall cost; total cost scales with the number of matches, multiplicatively on top of the per-PID scan cost already described in CR-4.
- Triggering conditions: Any request with filter_flags containing "u" or "aux" (the UI's default) combined with a regex that matches a non-trivial number of processes.
- Existing cleanup/bounding logic: Each helper independently wraps its work in try/except Exception (lines 69–73, 85–95) to avoid crashing on a single bad PID, but there is no batching, caching, or reuse of already-open file descriptors/data across the two extra reads per match.
- Plausible runtime consequence: For queries with many matches and the default "aux"-like flag, per-request cost is dominated by 2–3x the number of matched-process syscalls compared to the base scan, further extending response latency beyond the O(all PIDs) baseline from CR-4.
- Severity: low; Confidence: med
- Assumptions needing validation: Magnitude depends on how often filter_flags including u/aux is actually used by callers and how many matches typical queries return; would require profiling to confirm this is a measurable contributor versus the base scan cost.

Appendix B: FL-1..FL-6 (python-pro)

FL-1
- file: coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py
- lines: 158-177 (specifically 161, 166-170)
- fault and code evidence: pattern = re.compile(command_regex) (line 161) compiles a fully user-supplied, unvalidated regex (only length is bounded at lines 145-146, not complexity/structure), and pattern.search(cmd) is invoked once per PID inside the loop for pid in _list_pids(): ... if pattern.search(cmd): (lines 166-170).
- execution path: POST /monitor/commands -> _validate_payload (198) -> _match_processes (199, defined 158-177) -> re.compile/pattern.search executed synchronously in the request-handling thread.
- affected state/resource: the single request-handling thread/worker of the WSGI server; CPU time.
- triggering conditions: a client supplies a regex with catastrophic backtracking potential (e.g. nested quantifiers) against cmdline strings that trigger exponential-time matching; only a length cap (256 chars) is enforced, no complexity check or execution timeout.
- existing cleanup/bounding logic: only len(command_regex) > 256 (line 145) is checked; there is no timeout, no safe-regex validation, and no re.error handling beyond compile-time syntax errors (162-163). This does not bound backtracking time.
- plausible runtime consequence: re.search can run for a very long time (potentially unbounded) per matching attempt, occupying the handler thread; since this runs once per process on the host and cmdlines can be attacker-influenced length up to 4096 bytes (line 54), worst-case matching time compounds across all enumerated PIDs.
- severity: high; confidence: med (backtracking depends on regex engine internals and actual pattern supplied, not verifiable without execution).
- assumptions needing runtime validation: actual CPython re backtracking behavior/timing for pathological patterns against realistic cmdline lengths; whether typical /proc cmdline sizes are large enough to make this practically significant.

FL-2
- file: coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py
- lines: 330-332
- fault and code evidence: app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=3000, debug=False) — no threaded=True, no processes=, and no production WSGI server is configured.
- execution path: process entrypoint if __name__ == "__main__": (330) directly launches the Werkzeug development server used to serve all routes including /monitor/commands (184) and /health (306).
- affected state/resource: the single-threaded/single-process WSGI server; all incoming HTTP connections share this one execution context.
- triggering conditions: any concurrent request arriving while a prior request is still executing _match_processes (e.g., during the O(N) /proc scan or a long-running regex match from FL-1).
- existing cleanup/bounding logic: none — Werkzeug's default dev server (absent threaded/processes args) handles one request at a time; this is not overridden anywhere in the file.
- plausible runtime consequence: any single slow request (large process count, expensive regex, or a stalled I/O read) blocks all other clients, including /health (306-308), for the full duration of that request, producing full-service unavailability under concurrent load rather than isolated slowness.
- severity: high; confidence: high (directly evidenced by the app.run call and absence of threading/process flags in this file).
- assumptions needing runtime validation: whether this script is actually run standalone via __main__ in production versus behind a separate WSGI server (e.g., gunicorn) not shown in this file; if a production server config exists elsewhere with threading enabled, this finding would not apply at runtime.

FL-3
- file: coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py
- lines: 98-110, 165-177
- fault and code evidence: _list_pids() (98-110) performs os.listdir("/proc") and filters/sorts synchronously; for every returned PID, _match_processes (158-177) calls _read_cmdline(pid) (167) which opens /proc/<pid>/cmdline (53) — all executed inline, per request, with no caching, memoization, or pagination.
- execution path: every call to POST /monitor/commands (184) triggers this full re-scan of /proc and per-PID file opens from scratch (199 -> 158-177).
- affected state/resource: filesystem I/O (/proc reads) and CPU time within the single request-handling thread (see FL-2); no cross-request cache exists — app (23) holds no shared state for this data.
- triggering conditions: any request to /monitor/commands; cost scales linearly with the number of live processes on the host (_list_pids result size) and is repeated in full on every single request, even for identical/rapid repeat queries.
- existing cleanup/bounding logic: _safe_read_text/_read_cmdline cap bytes read per file (max_bytes=1_000_000 at 35, f.read(4096) at 54) which bounds per-file cost, but nothing bounds the number of PIDs processed per request or the request rate/frequency of full rescans.
- plausible runtime consequence: on hosts with a large number of processes, per-request latency grows linearly with process count and is fully re-paid on every call; combined with FL-2's single-threaded server, this increases the window during which other requests are blocked.
- severity: med; confidence: med (actual latency depends on host process count and filesystem characteristics, not verifiable statically).
- assumptions needing runtime validation: typical/expected process count on target hosts; actual per-syscall latency of /proc reads under load.

FL-4
- file: coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py
- lines: 186-195 (and app creation at 23)
- fault and code evidence: payload = request.get_json(silent=True) (186) and fallback raw = request.data or b"" (188) are called with no app.config["MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH"] set anywhere in the file (the Flask(__name__) instantiation at line 23 uses defaults).
- execution path: every POST /monitor/commands request body is fully buffered by Werkzeug/Flask into memory via request.data/get_json before any size validation occurs (the only length checks, at lines 145 and 152, apply to individual JSON field values after parsing, not to the raw body).
- affected state/resource: per-request memory allocation for the request body buffer and the parsed JSON structure.
- triggering conditions: a client sends an arbitrarily large HTTP request body to /monitor/commands; Flask's default MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH is None (unbounded).
- existing cleanup/bounding logic: none at the body-size level; _validate_payload (135-155) only bounds specific string fields after the entire body has already been read and JSON-parsed (or attempted via json.loads at line 191 on the full decoded string).
- plausible runtime consequence: large request bodies are fully read into memory and decoded/parsed before rejection, increasing per-request memory footprint proportional to attacker-controlled body size; under the single-threaded server (FL-2) this ties up the sole worker for the duration of the read/parse.
- severity: med; confidence: high (directly evidenced by absence of MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH config and unconditional full-body access).
- assumptions needing runtime validation: whether an upstream reverse proxy (not present in this file) already enforces a body-size limit in the actual deployment.

FL-5
- file: coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py
- lines: 165-177, 199-200
- fault and code evidence: results: List[Dict[str, Any]] = [] accumulates one entry per matching PID with no cap (165-177), and matches = _match_processes(...) is passed directly to jsonify(matches) (199-200) with no truncation or pagination.
- execution path: POST /monitor/commands -> _match_processes builds an unbounded results list -> jsonify serializes the full list into the HTTP response body.
- affected state/resource: response-serialization memory and time; HTTP response payload size.
- triggering conditions: a broad command_regex (e.g. . or .*) matches most/all processes on a host with many running processes, or a permissive pattern matches a large fraction of /proc entries.
- existing cleanup/bounding logic: none — no limit/max_results parameter or default cap exists in _validate_payload (135-155) or _match_processes (158-177).
- plausible runtime consequence: response payload size and JSON-serialization cost scale with total matching process count, increasing memory use and response latency for the single request-handling thread (compounding FL-2/FL-3).
- severity: low; confidence: med (impact magnitude depends on host process counts, not verifiable statically).
- assumptions needing runtime validation: realistic upper bound on process counts and how often broad/matching-all regexes would be issued in practice.

FL-6
- file: coding-task-shared/python-flask/monitor/monitor.py
- lines: 113-132 (_build_process_string), 67-73 (_read_user), 76-95 (_read_stat)
- fault and code evidence: when include_user is true (line 125, derived from filter_flags), _build_process_string performs two additional per-PID filesystem operations beyond the cmdline read already done in the caller: _read_user(pid) (126) does os.stat(f"/proc/{pid}") plus pwd.getpwuid(...) (70-71), and _read_stat(pid) (127) does a full _safe_read_text(f"/proc/{pid}/stat", ...) open/read (78). These are executed once per matching PID, per request, with no memoization even within a single request when the same PID's data could be reused.
- execution path: _match_processes (166-176) calls _build_process_string for every matched PID (174) whenever filter_flags contains "u" or "aux" (122-123), triggering the extra os.stat, pwd.getpwuid, and file-read calls inline in the request thread.
- affected state/resource: additional filesystem/syscall I/O (stat, open, read) and pwd database lookups, all synchronous, within the single request-handling thread (see FL-2).
- triggering conditions: client sets filter_flags to include "u" or "aux" substring (123) while also supplying a broad command_regex matching many PIDs (compounds with FL-5).
- existing cleanup/bounding logic: _safe_read_text bounds bytes read per call (35, max_bytes=4096 at 78) and exceptions are swallowed (72, 94), but there is no bound on the number of PIDs for which these extra calls are made per request.
- plausible runtime consequence: for requests with include_user=True and many matches, per-request syscall count multiplies (roughly 3x additional syscalls per matched PID beyond the base cmdline read), increasing latency and blocking the single worker thread proportionally longer.
- severity: low; confidence: med (actual syscall cost and host process counts not verifiable statically).
- assumptions needing runtime validation: frequency of filter_flags usage triggering include_user, and actual per-syscall latency (os.stat, pwd.getpwuid, proc stat read) on the target OS/filesystem.
