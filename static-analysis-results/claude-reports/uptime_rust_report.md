PERFORMANCE-ENGINEER FINAL CONSOLIDATED REPORT (verbatim)

Adjudication Report — coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs

Verified directly against the file (175 lines, single module, no other .rs files under sin both handoffs were checked against the actual source and are accurate to within 1-2lines of comment offset.

Finding 1 — Unbounded growth of the shared Db map

Merged: CR-1 + RE-4
Static validity: confirmed — lines 97-98 (db.entry(req.token.clone()).or_insert_with(HashMap::new), service_map.insert(req.serviceId.clone(), timestamp)) are the only mutation points in the file; no removal,
TTL, eviction, or reset/delete endpoint exists anywhere in main.rs. AppState.db is const150-152) and lives for the process lifetime.
Performance relevance: direct (heap retention), but the rate of degradation is conditional on workload.
Affected resource: process heap backing Mutex<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>>.
Triggering condition — important qualification not explicit in either handoff: growth only occurs on new distinct token or serviceId values. Repeated heartbeats with an identical (token, serviceId) pair only
overwrite the timestamp value in place — no map growth. So this mechanism requires a workey cardinality over time, not merely sustained repeat traffic.
Cleanup/bounds: none present.
Direct evidence vs. assumption: additive-only code path is direct evidence; whether realg distinct-key cardinality (vs. a fixed small client set) is a workload assumption.
Mechanism class: cumulative resource retention.
Aging relevance: conditionally plausible aging mechanism — satisfies repeatable trigger, absent bounding, but the "progressive degradation during long-running execution" elementis conditional on distinct-key cardinality actually growing over the run, not just request volume.
Final severity: high. Final confidence: high (code evidence) / medium (real-world materi

Finding 2 — Single global std::sync::Mutex serializing both handlers, used synchronously inside async fn

Merged: CR-2 + RE-2 + RE-3
Static validity: confirmed — one Mutex<HashMap<...>> (line 13) is locked synchronously vside async fn heartbeat/async fn get_services for every request, with no sharding, noRwLock, no tokio::sync::Mutex, no spawn_blocking.
Performance relevance: direct, but scales with concurrency, not elapsed time.
Affected resource: the single mutex and the Actix worker OS thread executing the async task while blocked on it.
Triggering condition: overlapping concurrent requests to either endpoint; magnitude is ancurrency level, not process uptime.
Cleanup/bounds: none (no read/write split despite get_services being read-only).
Direct evidence vs. assumption: the blocking-primitive-in-async pattern is direct evidenlls unrelated co-located tasks depends on Actix's per-worker runtime/scheduling model atruntime (unconfirmed here).
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead (recurs per concurrent request; does not acifetime).
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault — missing the "progressive accumulation" element; this is a standing concurrency bottleneck present from process start, not something that worsens purely due to
elapsed runtime.
Final severity: medium. Final confidence: high (pattern) / medium (magnitude, since it depends on Actix's threading model).

---
Finding 3 — Lock held through full clone+sort in get_services

Merged: CR-4 + RE-5
Static validity: confirmed — the guard db (line 116) remains in scope through the iteration/clone loop (lines 128-135) and sort_by (line 138); there is no early drop(db).
Performance relevance: direct, extends Finding 2's critical section length.
Affected resource: same mutex as Finding 2; hold time scales O(n) clone + O(n log n) sort with the size of the per-token service_map.
Triggering condition: /services calls for tokens with larger per-token maps, concurrent
Cleanup/bounds: none — data could be copied and the guard dropped before sorting, but isn't.
Direct evidence vs. assumption: lock scope is direct evidence; practical materiality depdinality (assumption).
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead per call. Note: this finding only becomes progressively worse over the run if the underlying per-token map itself grows unboundedly (i.e., it is coupled to
Finding 1) — it is not an independent time-progressive mechanism on its own.
Aging relevance: conditionally plausible aging mechanism only as a compounding effect of Finding 1 (if per-token service cardinality grows over the run, this hold-time and hence Finding 2's contention
severity would grow correspondingly); not independently aging-relevant.
Final severity: medium (as a compounding factor) / low standalone. Final confidence: medium.

---
Finding 4 — No length cap on token/serviceId before use as map keys/values

Standalone: CR-3 (not raised by RE)
Static validity: confirmed — line 79 only checks trim().is_empty(); no max-length validation exists anywhere in the file.
Performance relevance: conditional — actual per-entry size bound depends on Actix's defaimit, which is not set explicitly in this file (only the error_handler is overridden atlines 156-164), so the effective limit is an external/framework-default fact not visible in main.rs.
Affected resource: per-entry heap size within Finding 1's map; per-request CPU for hashi
Triggering condition: any client-supplied large string, bounded only by whatever implicit framework default applies.
Cleanup/bounds: none in this file.
Direct evidence vs. assumption: absence of an explicit cap is direct evidence; whether the framework default meaningfully bounds this in practice is an environment-dependent assumption.
Mechanism class: transient/repeated overhead per request; acts as a rate-multiplier on F an independent unbounded-growth source.
Aging relevance: non-aging performance fault standalone; only aging-relevant insofar as it accelerates Finding 1.
Final severity: low-medium. Final confidence: medium.

---
Finding 5 — Poisoned mutex has no recovery path, causing permanent 500s after a panic

Merged: CR-5 + RE-1
Static validity: confirmed that no recovery code exists (no PoisonError::into_inner() and regarding whether the triggering panic is realistically reachable.
Performance relevance: conditional/marginal — this is fundamentally a binary availability failure (permanent 100%-error state), not a graded performance decay; it is only "performance"-relevant in the
degenerate sense of infinite effective latency after an unproven trigger event.
Affected resource: the single global mutex; all subsequent requests to both handlers for the remainder of the process.
Triggering condition: a panic occurring between lock() and guard drop. On direct re-inspsections (lines 97-98 and 128-138), they contain only HashMapentry/insert/get/iterate/clone/sort_by calls — none of which panic under normal Rust semantics. Both reviewers themselves acknowledge no concrete panic path is visible and speculate about "allocation
failure" as a trigger; note that in standard Rust, allocator OOM triggers handle_alloc_eatchable panic — so the specific mechanism both reviewers propose for reaching this stateis itself technically questionable, not merely unverified.
Cleanup/bounds: none.
Direct evidence vs. assumption: absence-of-recovery-code is direct evidence; existence of any realistic trigger is unsupported speculation in both handoffs and remains unsupported after re-reading the cited
lines.
Mechanism class: unsupported — the "repeatable trigger" element required for any classification is missing.
Aging relevance: unsupported as an aging mechanism (a single unevidenced trigger producis not progressive degradation); also arguably outside primary performance scope(resilience/availability rather than performance decay).
Final severity: low (downgraded from CR-5/RE-1's medium/high). Final confidence: low.

SELF-SOURCED — UNVALIDATED (not cross-checked, for visibility only)

1. Line 97: db.entry(req.token.clone()) unconditionally clones req.token into a new String on every heartbeat call, even when the token key already exists in the map — HashMap::entry requires an owned key
argument regardless of whether the entry is vacant or occupied, so for pre-existing tokeated and then immediately dropped. This is a repeated (not cumulative) per-requestallocator overhead, distinct from the cumulative-retention concern in Finding 1; not itself an aging mechanism (no accumulation) but a candidate for further review as repeated overhead.

APPENDIX A — RAW PHASE-1 HANDOFF: CODE-REVIEWER (CR-*), unedited

Findings

CR-1
- File: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 12-17, 97-98
- Fault: The shared state type Db = Mutex<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>> (linry heartbeat via db.entry(req.token.clone()).or_insert_with(HashMap::new) andservice_map.insert(req.serviceId.clone(), timestamp) (lines 97-98) but nothing ever removes entries — no TTL, no eviction, no size cap, and no delete/reset endpoint exists anywhere in the file.
- Execution path: every POST to /heartbeat → heartbeat() handler → outer map keyed by toceId, both grow monotonically.
- Affected state/resource: process heap memory backing the Db HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>> for the lifetime of the server process.
- Triggering conditions: sustained or repeated heartbeat traffic with distinct token/seral client bugs, retries with changing IDs, or long-running production usage).
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle/bounding logic: none present; the only state mutation operators (entry/or_insert_with, insert) are strictly additive/overwriting, never removing.
- Plausible runtime consequence: unbounded heap growth over the server's lifetime, event/allocator pressure, degraded response latency, or process OOM under sustained load.
- Severity: high. Confidence: high.
- Assumptions needing validation: actual growth rate depends on real-world cardinality oirs and server uptime; would need memory profiling under sustained traffic to confirm OOMtimeline.

CR-2
- File: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 5, 13, 87-94, 116-123
- Fault: A single process-wide std::sync::Mutex (line 5, 13) guards the entire HashMap and is acquired synchronously (data.db.lock(), lines 87 and 116) inside async fn handlers for both /heartbeat and
/services, so all concurrent requests to either endpoint — regardless of token — seriali
- Execution path: any concurrent invocation of heartbeat() and/or get_services() across all actix worker threads contends for the same Mutex guard before doing any per-token work.
- Affected state/resource: the single global Mutex<HashMap<...>> and, indirectly, the to block (rather than yield) while waiting on lock().
- Triggering conditions: concurrent request volume greater than one in-flight request at a time (multi-worker actix runtime handling simultaneous heartbeats/service queries).
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle/bounding logic: none — no sharding by token, no tokio::sync-aware yielding, no read/write lock split despite get_services only reading.
- Plausible runtime consequence: since std::sync::Mutex::lock() blocks the OS thread it runs on (rather than yielding to the async executor), sustained contention can stall the actix worker thread and reduce
effective request concurrency/throughput; this is compounded by having no separate read calls block behind /heartbeat writes and vice versa.
- Severity: medium. Confidence: high.
- Assumptions needing validation: actual throughput/latency impact depends on request co duration in production; would need load testing/thread-contention profiling to quantify.

CR-3
- File: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 79, 97-98
- Fault: Input validation only rejects empty/whitespace-only serviceId/token (line 79: r) || req.token.trim().is_empty()); there is no upper bound on string length for eitherfield before they are cloned and used as/inserted as HashMap keys/values (lines 97-98).
- Execution path: heartbeat() deserializes HeartbeatRequest from the JSON body via web::76), passes the length check at line 79, then stores the raw strings as map key/entries.
- Affected state/resource: heap memory for the Db map entries and CPU cost of String::clone()/hashing per request.
- Triggering conditions: any client sending a serviceId or token string of arbitrarily l framework's default payload-size limit permits (the JsonConfig in main(), lines 156-164,only overrides error_handler, not content_length_limit, so the default payload cap applies implicitly and is not visible/enforced in this file).
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle/bounding logic: only the non-empty check at line 79; no lendation.
- Plausible runtime consequence: combined with CR-1's unbounded retention, each stored entry can be large, accelerating memory growth per request and increasing per-request CPU cost for hashing/cloning large
strings, worsening throughput under adversarial or buggy client input.
- Severity: medium. Confidence: medium.
- Assumptions needing validation: the effective default payload-size limit of the actix se would need to be confirmed at runtime, since it is not explicitly set in this file.

CR-4
- File: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 116-140
- Fault: The mutex guard db (acquired line 116) remains held for the entire handler bodyrvice_map) = db.get(&req.token) iteration/clone loop (lines 128-135) and the subsequentresponse_list.sort_by(...) (line 138) — since it is never explicitly dropped before those operations; it is only released implicitly when the function returns.
- Execution path: get_services() acquires the lock, then performs O(n) cloning and O(n l service entries while still holding the global lock from CR-2.
- Affected state/resource: the same global Mutex from CR-2, held for a longer duration than the minimal data-copy needed.
- Triggering conditions: any call to /services for a token with a non-trivial number of g while other requests attempt to acquire the same lock.
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle/bounding logic: no early drop(db) after extracting the needed data; the sort and iteration are performed under the lock rather than after releasing it.
- Plausible runtime consequence: extends the critical section length under the single glcontention/latency for concurrent /heartbeat and /services calls proportional to the sizeof the per-token service map being sorted.
- Severity: medium. Confidence: medium.
- Assumptions needing validation: the practical impact scales with typical per-token service-map size and request concurrency; would require profiling lock-wait time under load to confirm materiality.

CR-5
- File: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 87-94, 116-123
- Fault: Both handlers treat a poisoned mutex (Err(_) branch on data.db.lock()) as a per-request 500 response with no attempt to recover the poisoned state (e.g., via PoisonError::into_inner()), and there is
no other code path anywhere in the file that ever clears or recovers from poisoning.
- Execution path: if the guarded critical section (lines 97-98 or 128-138) ever panics while the lock is held, std::sync::Mutex becomes permanently poisoned for the remaining process lifetime; every
subsequent call to either handler will take the Err(_) branch (lines 89-93, 118-122) andndefinitely.
- Affected state/resource: the single global Mutex (shared by both endpoints) and, transitively, all future /heartbeat and /services requests for the remaining process lifetime.
- Triggering conditions: a panic occurring while the lock is held; no such panic is curr critical sections themselves, but any future code path (or an out-of-memory allocationfailure inside HashMap insert/clone) taking a panic under the lock would trigger this.
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle/bounding logic: only the Err(_) => InternalServerError fallvery, restart, or health-check/self-healing logic, so degradation is permanent oncetriggered.
- Plausible runtime consequence: total, unrecoverable service outage (every request 500sder the lock, requiring a full process restart to recover.
- Severity: medium. Confidence: low-medium (no concrete panic-triggering path is directly visible in the current critical sections, so likelihood of triggering is speculative pending further analysis of
allocation-failure/panic behavior).
- Assumptions needing validation: would need to confirm whether any panic (including allocator OOM panics) is realistically reachable while the lock is held in this codebase as currently written.

APPENDIX B — RAW PHASE-1 HANDOFF: RUST-ENGINEER (RE-*), unedited

Findings

RE-1
- ID/file: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 87-94 and 116-123
- Fault and evidence: Mutex lock errors are handled by returning InternalServerError butd is never recovered:
let mut db = match data.db.lock() {
    Ok(guard) => guard,
    Err(_) => { return HttpResponse::InternalServerError()... }
};
- This pattern is repeated identically at line 116 for get_services. Once data.db (the single Mutex<HashMap<...>> at line 13/16) is poisoned by any panic while the lock is held (e.g. inside the entry/insert
block at lines 97-98, or during JSON serialization panics elsewhere in the process), eve on this Mutex from any handler, on any worker thread, returns Err, and there is noPoisonError::into_inner() recovery path anywhere in the file.
- Execution path: any panic during the critical section of heartbeat (lines 87-98) poisore heartbeat and get_services invocations across all Actix workers hit the Err(_) branch.
- Affected state/resource: the single global AppState.db: Mutex<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>> shared via web::Data across all worker threads.
- Triggering conditions: a single panic anywhere between lock() acquisition and guard dre.g. from an unexpected panic in HashMap operations or future code changes inside thecritical section.
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle logic: none — no unwrap_or_else(|poisoned| poisoned.into_in exists; the poisoned state persists for the lifetime of the process since AppState iscreated once in main (lines 150-152) and shared for the server's entire run.
- Plausible runtime consequence: after one panic, the entire service becomes permanentlyt returns 500) until process restart, with no self-healing.
- Severity: high; Confidence: high
- Assumptions needing validation: whether any code path inside the lock (currently just 7-98) can actually panic in practice (e.g., via allocation failure) — would needfault-injection/runtime testing to confirm reachability of the poisoning condition itself, though the absence of recovery logic is directly evidenced regardless.

RE-2
- ID/file: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 13, 15-17, 87-94, 11
- Fault and evidence: a single, application-wide std::sync::Mutex<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>> (type Db = Mutex<HashMap<...>>; line 13) is the sole synchronization primitive guarding all state
for all tokens and services. Both heartbeat (line 87) and get_services (line 116) acquiruest, with no sharding/partitioning by token.
- Execution path: HttpServer::new (line 154) spins up multiple worker threads (Actix default = number of CPUs) that all share the same state web::Data<AppState> (line 167, .app_data(state.clone()) clones the
Arc, not the inner Mutex/HashMap); every request handled by any worker serializes on thi
- Affected state/resource: AppState.db, contended across every concurrent /heartbeat and /services request regardless of token.
- Triggering conditions: concurrent requests for different, unrelated tokens still conteoken locking), so throughput degrades under concurrent load proportional to total requestrate rather than per-token rate.
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle logic: none — there is no lock striping, RwLock (which wouleaders in get_services), or per-token map; a plain Mutex is used even for the read-onlyget_services path (line 116), so reads block writes and other reads.
- Plausible runtime consequence: under multi-worker concurrent load, request latency inc that scales with total traffic rather than with data-partition size; get_services readsunnecessarily block on writers and other readers instead of allowing concurrent read access.
- Severity: med; Confidence: high
- Assumptions needing validation: actual contention magnitude depends on request rate and number of workers/CPUs at runtime — would need load-test/profiling to quantify latency impact.

RE-3
- ID/file: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 87-94, 116-123
- Fault and evidence: data.db.lock() is a blocking, synchronous std::sync::Mutex::lock() call made directly inside async fn heartbeat and async fn get_services (declared async fn at lines 74 and 105) with no
web::block, spawn_blocking, or block_in_place wrapper.
- Execution path: when the lock is contended (held by another in-flight request's critical section on a different worker/task), the calling worker thread executes a blocking OS-level wait inside the async
task rather than yielding to the executor.
- Affected state/resource: the Tokio/Actix worker thread executing the handler task, and any other tasks scheduled on that same OS thread.
- Triggering conditions: concurrent requests to /heartbeat or /services overlapping in tock hold (lines 87-98 or 116-138) is still active when another arrives on the same workerthread.
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle logic: none — the critical sections themselves are short (He+clone+sort), which bounds the blocking window, but there is no explicit yielding oroff-loading mechanism; correctness of "not stalling the executor" here relies entirely on critical-section brevity rather than any explicit guarantee in the code.
- Plausible runtime consequence: under sufficient concurrent load, worker-thread stalls d Mutex could delay processing of unrelated tasks co-located on that thread, increasingtail latency.
- Severity: low; Confidence: med
- Assumptions needing validation: whether Actix's runtime configuration (thread-per-worker vs. work-stealing multi-thread runtime) actually co-locates unrelated tasks on the same OS thread during contention
— this is a runtime/scheduler detail requiring profiling to confirm actual impact severi

RE-4
- ID/file: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 13, 97-98
- Fault and evidence: service_map.insert(req.serviceId.clone(), timestamp); (line 98) an.or_insert_with(HashMap::new) (line 97) only ever add entries to the nested HashMaps;there is no eviction, expiration, size cap, or removal logic anywhere in the file for either the outer token map or inner per-token service map.
- Execution path: every distinct (token, serviceId) pair ever POSTed to /heartbeat creatry in AppState.db for the lifetime of the process.
- Affected state/resource: AppState.db: Mutex<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>>, held in the single long-lived web::Data instance created once in main (lines 150-152) and never reset/rotated.
- Triggering conditions: sustained traffic with many unique tokens and/or many unique sevalidation limits distinct token/serviceId cardinality).
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle logic: none present in the reviewed source — no TTL, LRU, capacity bound, or periodic cleanup task.
- Plausible runtime consequence: unbounded process memory growth over the service's upti of distinct token/serviceId combinations seen, with no bound; sustained/adversarial input could exhaust available memory over time.
- Severity: med; Confidence: high
- Assumptions needing validation: actual growth rate depends on real-world traffic patterns (token/serviceId cardinality) — would need runtime memory profiling under sustained load to quantify
time-to-exhaustion.

RE-5
- ID/file: coding-task-shared/rust/Uptime/Uptime/src/main.rs, lines 116-138
- Fault and evidence: in get_services, the Mutex guard db (acquired line 116) is held acr-entry String cloning (sid.clone(), time.clone() at lines 131-132), Vec construction, and the sort_by call (line 138) before being dropped at the end of scope — the lock is not released until after sorting completes.
- Execution path: any concurrent heartbeat or get_services call for any token must wait m-sort sequence to finish while it is in flight, since the same single global Mutex(line 13) is used for all tokens.
- Affected state/resource: AppState.db lock hold duration, and thus availability of the requests (interacts with RE-2/RE-3).
- Triggering conditions: a token with a large per-token service_map (many serviceId entries) being queried via /services concurrently with other /heartbeat or /services requests.
- Existing cleanup/lifecycle logic: none — no early lock release (e.g., cloning the targuard before iterating/sorting); the borrow of service_map from inside db (line 128,db.get(&req.token)) structurally ties the guard's lifetime to the entire transform+sort block.
- Plausible runtime consequence: larger per-token service counts proportionally extend treasing contention/latency for all other concurrent requests, not just those for the sametoken.
- Severity: low; Confidence: med
- Assumptions needing validation: real-world per-token serviceId cardinality and concurrent request rate would need to be profiled to determine whether this hold-time extension is practically significant.
